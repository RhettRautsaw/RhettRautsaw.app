# PlatinumPedigreeAlns

This GitHub page hosts an HTML using IGV.js to provide a data comparison between different technologies used in the Platinum Pedigree. 

Specifically, the alignments are from HG001 (NA12878) in the Platinum Pedigree 
(<a href="https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Datasets" target="_blank">GitHub</a> | 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.02.616333v1" target="_blank">Preprint</a>). 

The alignment by default loads a view of "STRC", but feel free to search for and explore other genes!

Note that PacBio HiFi is fully phased and shown twice (once for the sequence data and once for methylation). 
To see a good example of haplotype phased methylation, look up "chr11:2,697,000-2,705,000" to zoom into a specific region of the KCNQ1 gene.
